# Datonym

Find a name you love.

I have a special affinity for certain characteristics of names. Datonym enables myself, story-writers, parents, daydreamers, and others to find names perfect for their purposes.

When it's done, it'll be live at [datonym.me](https://datonym.me).

## Data source

Data is from the [SSA's dataset](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html).

It contains frequency of names of individuals with a Social Security Number born in a particular year.

Names with less than five occurrences per year are excluded, but that is okay for our purposes. Don't feel bad if your name is missing, it means you're special!

## Data features

Symmetry, androgynity, trendiness, and vowelness are just a few of the characteristics available.

## App features
